# Community Hackathon

This page is designed to provide guidance, and ideas on running a Community Hackathon.  

## Steps to run a Community Hackathon

#### 1. Determine Name, Purpose and Outcomes of the Hackathon

Is this a hackathon, workshop or openhack? If it's a hackathon, what is the problem statement? 

Either in combination with, or subsequent to this step (after pitching the idea), the organizing team should be formed.

#### 2. Set Date and Determine Event Duration

After you understand the goals and expected outcomes, you can start building a timeline for the event. The type of event, required advertising, time to get resources in place, etc. will all affect when you should run the event.

Event duration can be variable. If you are only ideating and building "slideware", the event can much much shorter than if you are trying to build an MVP or working prototype. As reference, ideation should be given at least 2 hours and 2 hours for presentation development. These types of events can typically be run in a 6-8 hour day. Events with an expected outcome of an MVP or working prototype should accommodate at least an additional 6 hours of development time. Depending on the modality and accommodations, some hackathons can run multiple days for serious production. Be mindful of the participant's schedule, the longer the event the less likely they will be to dedicate their time.

#### 3. Determine the roles needed for the event.

See [Roles](/README.md#Roles) for further details.

#### 4. Determine how the event will be Advertised

Now that you've determined the Name, Purpose, Outcomes, Date, and Roles required you can start the process of advertising. Below are a common set of questions you can use as a starting point.

- Will the event require a website?
  - If so...
    - Where will it be hosted?
    - Who will build it?
    - Who will pay for it?
    - Who will maintain and own it?
    - Will it continue to exist after the event is over?
- Will social media be used?
- If so...
  - Which platform(s) will be used?
  - Will the event have its own account and if so, who will own them?
- Is there a different forum for recruiting different types of individuals (different skill sets, industry/experience, support, etc.)?
- How long will advertising take place before registration is opened?
- Is there a common set of materials used for marketing?

#### 5. Set Budget and Determine Finances

Financial budgeting is a common oversight with hackathons, below are some example expenses to use as a starting point.

- Registration form or website
- Microsoft Teams Tenant
- Prizes
- Developer Tools (Hardware/Software)
  - If you expect participants to bring their own, this needs to be clearly communicated.
- Lab environment
  - You may want to provide a temporary "sandbox" in which participants can work. Cloud capabilities like Azure make for a lower technological barrier to entry and allow for rapid development and testing.

If the event is being held in person, there will be additional costs such as the examples below.
- Venue
- Dining
- Event Staff (as required or suggested by the venue)
- Expenses for Keynote Speaker or other distinguished guests

Sponsorships can act as a form of income for the event to help cover the costs. Offering sponsorships can be a mutually beneficial engagement, though you should be careful to target the correct sponsors which add value to the event.

#### 6. Determine How and Where Artifacts will be Shared

Unless the goal of the hackathon is to be purely educational, artifacts (or deliverables) are a primary goal of the event. This means that a few decisions need to be made by the organizing team. 

- Where/how will teams collaborate on their work?
- Where will teams post their completed work at the end of the event?
  - Github?
  - Microsoft Teams?
  - Sharepoint/OneDrive?

Additional considerations when choosing a platform for collaborating and sharing work: 
- Can the content be Open Source? We suggest that it is - see [Open Source](/README.md#OpenSource)
- Are the organizers going to publish all of the content on behalf of the teams, or will the teams publish their content directly?
- Do any of the artifacts need "approved" before being shared (intellectual property, etc.)?

Lastly, if the event is being recorded at all (kickoff/closing, "action shots", etc.) there are considerations around that media. 
- Where will these be stored - Microsoft Stream, Youtube, Microsoft Teams?
- Who will own the content and under what account will it be shared?
- Who is doing the recording, and any needed "trimming" of the videos?
- Do participants need to sign a Media Release Consent? 
  - If not, provide notice to the participants when recording is about to start so they can choose whether or not they want to be recorded.

#### 7. Determine if Teams will be Assigned or Self-Organizing

Depending on the type of event, the organizers may want the teams to be self-organizing or to be assigned by the organizers. There are Pros and Cons to each configuration and the decision should be made specific to that event.

If the teams are going to self-organize, are the organizers going to help facilitate the formation of those teams (eg. a "lounge" or some sort, idea board, "profiles" with skills, etc.)? If the teams are going to be assigned, what is the criteria for the creation of those teams? We suggest trying to be as diverse as possible in relation to skills, background, and experience. Some suggested ways to organize teams is by attributes such as Time Zone, Role Type/Background, Level of Experience, Category/Problem Area Understanding, etc.

#### 8. Write a Summary of the Event including "Who, Why, When, How" and Expected Outcomes

Writing the event summary will be helpful when advertising so that you potential event participants can determine whether or not they will attend. Make sure to be as inclusive as possible in the wording of this summary as to not deter someone away, even if they may not be a "perfect fit" - that may just mean they can bring different viewpoints and experiences to the table.

Example:

> **Who:** This event is open to anyone who is interested in Healthcare outcomes, and the technology that enables patient care.
>
> **Why:** This event presents a rare opportunity for nurses, other healthcare professionals, developers, engineers, IT experts and other innovators with diverse ideas and skills to collaborate in real time to develop tech-based, minimally viable products (MVPs) that can help address todayâ€™s most pressing healthcare challenges.
>
> **When:** May 16th-18th (see agenda for more details)
>
> **How:** Register Here (insert link)! Each registrant will be guided through a process to create your profile, pitch ideas, and create or join a team.
>
> **Outcomes:** We hope to have teams that have ideas or projects either as practitioners, or technologists which they can further collaborate on after the event and help drive towards implementation.

At this point you may also want to determine the following items which may help incentivize hackers.

- Can the event be "gamified"? Depending on the type of event, the ability to have "points", "levels" or "badges" may help motivate the participants.
- Will there be winners, or prizes? This can help with a bit of friendly competition, and help drive participants towards a goal.
  - If so, who will adjudicate?

#### 9. Create a List of Pre-Hack Educational Material

Depending on the event, the organizers may want to put together material to review at their own pace to help the event run more smoothly. This could be reading, videos, etc.

Training material could include things like the following:

- How to create / join a team
- How to use the collaboration platform(s), (eg. Microsoft Teams, Github, etc.)
- Design Thinking Material
- Training for Specific Technical Resources

#### 10. Create and Publish the Agenda

An agenda is important to help frame the event, both for the organizers and the participants.

Example:

>Example Event Timeline:
>
> - (date) Registration Content and Site Ready
> - (date) Registration opens
> - (date) Event Kickoff
>   - (time) Kickoff / Keynote
>   - Problem Pitching
>   - Team Formation
> - (date) Hackathon Day 1
>   - (time) Start Ideating
>   - (time) Start Building
> - (date) Hackathon Day 2
>   - (time) Stop building / Start Sharing
>   - (time) Closing Remarks
> - (date) Event Retrospective (organizers, but may include participants if desired)
