# Community Hackathon

This page is designed to provide guidance, and ideas on running a Community Hackathon.  

## Steps to run a Community Hackathon

#### 1. Determine Name, Purpose and Outcomes of the Hackathon

Is this a hackathon, workshop or openhack? If it's a hackathon, what is the problem statement? 

Either in combination with, or subsequent to this step (after pitching the idea), the organizing team should be formed.

#### 2. Set Date and Determine Event Duration

After you understand the goals and expected outcomes, you can start building a timeline for the event. The type of event, required advertising, time to get resources in place, etc. will all affect when you should run the event. 

Event duration can be variable. If you are only ideating and building "slideware", the event can much much shorter than if you are trying to build an MVP or working prototype. As reference, ideation should be given at least 2 hours and 2 hours for presentation development. These types of events can typically be run in a 6-8 hour day. Events with an expected outcome of an MVP or working prototype should accommodate at least an additional 6 hours of development time. Depending on the modality and accommodations, some hackathons can run multiple days for serious production. Be mindful of the participant's schedule, the longer the event the less likely they will be to dedicate their time.

>Example Event Timeline:
>
> - (date) Registration Content and Site Ready
> - (date) Registration opens
> - (date) Event Kickoff
>   - (time) Kickoff / Keynote
>   - Problem Pitching
>   - Team Formation
> - (date) Hackathon Day 1
>   - (time) Start Ideating
>   - (time) Start Building
> - (date) Hackathon Day 2
>   - (time) Stop building / Start Sharing
>   - (time) Closing Remarks
> - (date) Event Retrospective (organizers, but may include participants if desired)

#### 3. Determine the roles needed for the event.

See [Roles](/README.md#Roles) for further details.

#### 4. Determine how the event will be Advertised

Now that you've determined the Name, Purpose, Outcomes, Date, and Roles required you can start the process of advertising. Below are a common set of questions you can use as a starting point.

- Will the event require a website?
  - If so...
    - Where will it be hosted?
    - Who will build it?
    - Who will pay for it?
    - Who will maintain and own it?
    - Will it continue to exist after the event is over?
- Will social media be used?
- If so...
  - Which platform(s) will be used?
  - Will the event have its own account and if so, who will own them?
- Is there a different forum for recruiting different types of individuals (different skill sets, industry/experience, support, etc.)?
- How long will advertising take place before registration is opened?
- Is there a common set of materials used for marketing?

#### 5. Set Budget and Determine Finances

Financial budgeting is a common oversight with hackathons, below are some example expenses to use as a starting point.

- Registration form or website
- Microsoft Teams Tenant
- Prizes
- Developer Tools (Hardware/Software)
  - If you expect participants to bring their own, this needs to be clearly communicated.
- Lab environment
  - You may want to provide a temporary "sandbox" in which participants can work. Cloud capabilities like Azure make for a lower technological barrier to entry and allow for rapid development and testing.

If the event is being held in person, there will be additional costs such as the examples below.
- Venue
- Dining
- Event Staff (as required or suggested by the venue)
- Expenses for Keynote Speaker or other distinguished guests

Sponsorships can act as a form of income for the event to help cover the costs. Offering sponsorships can be a mutually beneficial engagement, though you should be careful to target the correct sponsors which add value to the event.
