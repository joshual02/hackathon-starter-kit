# Hackathon Starter Kit

The purpose of this project is to provide a baseline of understanding, steps to be taken, best practices and guidance on how to run a Hackathon. This project will contain information on how to run two types of Hackathons: 

- **Corporate Internal Hackathon**: all participants are employed by a single organization. These are often the most simple hackathons to run, and can produce multiple types of artifacts including Open Source, Inner Source, and potentially Intellectual Property.
- **Community Hackathon**: participants are mostly sourced from the public. Due to the marketing tasks and varied experience of the participants, these can be the most complex to run. The artifacts created in Community Hackathons are typically (but not always) Open Source.

The content provided here is derived from the experiences of the contributors, makes no claim that this guidance is the only way to execute on these events and as such welcome input from the community in any regard (please see [Contributing](#Contributing) for further details).

## What is a Hackathon?

At its core, a hackathon is a short-burst event in which individuals typically form teams to intensively collaborate on projects which are designed around the problem statement or ideas provided by the hackathon organizers.

"Hacking" is most commonly used in the negative sense of an illegal act of computer crime to access resources which would otherwise be inaccessable. In the context of a hackathon though, the definition is one of the alternatives meaning to "cut with rough or heavy blows" (the act of intense focus on the project) or "manage; cope; muddle through".

A hackathon is underpinned and identified by these core tenants:
- Creative poblem solving, which does not have to include a technological (software, etc.) component. 
- A gathering of individuals working together, attempting to solve a common problem or set of problems.

## Problem Types and Categories

Without a problem to address, or categorical area of focus, participants in a hackathon are likely to spend too much time trying to determine a path and may ultimately not provide value to the intended goal of the event. For this reason it is important to define the problem statement, and or areas of focus ahead of time.

Keep in mind that even if you do ask the participants to bring their own problem statements (which is completely fine), it's helpful to provide problem types or categories to help keep the event focused. Remember, hackathons generally have a constrained amount of time. One of the most difficult components of that aspect is balancing specific direction and ideation of the partipants.

The additional focus helps participants understand the goals of the hackathon. The topic(s) may also help participants understand what skills or experiences may be needed, in addition to the expected outcomes. This is especially important when it may be helpful to have less technical individuals on the team that may bring other skills to bear (eg. experience in that type of situation, industry experience, etc.). 

The additional categorical focus should also make it easier to identify and recruit coaches and panelists - subject matter or technical. If you know that you want to focus on building a next-generation Medical Records System, then you know you'll likely need expertise in Heathcare, EMRs, Software Development, and Data Development.

## Roles

Although some hacakthons seem to be an event where people show up and do their own thing, that's likely intentional, and a lot of work goes into these events. While not all of the below roles are required for each type of hackathon, these are common functions within hackathons.

- Organizers - this role often represents one or more of the following personas:
  - Budget holders - approve any expenses
  - Marketing - define and execute a marketing plan to attract participants and raise public awareness
  - Technologists - provisioning or creating any required resources (eg. Website, Microsoft teams, etc.)
- Support - depending on the size of the event, this may require one or more of the following personas:
  - Topic Leads
    - One for each "topic" or category
    - Moderates sharing sessions at the end of the hackathon which align with their topic or category.
    - Will work to attract people specific to their problem space.
  - Tech Mentors - deep technical expertise in topic-relevant areas; ideally each team will have a tech mentor.
  - Agile/Design Thinking Mentors - individuals skilled in helping teams break down problems and drive for a Minimally Viable Product (MVP).
- Participants - individuals that are (hopefully) working on a team with others. The more diversity of talent, skills, experiences, and background on a team the more learning oportunities for everyone in addition to a better deliverable.
