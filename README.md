# Hackathon Starter Kit

The purpose of this project is to provide a baseline of understanding, steps to be taken, best practices and guidance on how to run a Hackathon. This project will contain information on how to run two types of Hackathons: 

- **Corporate Internal Hackathon**: all participants are employed by a single organization. These are often the most simple hackathons to run, and can produce multiple types of artifacts including Open Source, Inner Source, and potentially Intellectual Property.
- **Community Hackathon**: participants are mostly sourced from the public. Due to the marketing tasks and varied experience of the participants, these can be the most complex to run. The artifacts created in Community Hackathons are typically (but not always) Open Source.

The content provided here is derived from the experiences of the contributors, makes no claim that this guidance is the only way to execute on these events and as such welcome input from the community in any regard (please see [Contributing](#Contributing) for further details).

## What is a Hackathon?

No, unfortunately, it's not like the Matrix. We will not try hacking into a system. Although... the event COULD have a goal of hacking into some database to test out a system's security it is not how the term is used in the tech industry.

At its core, a hackathon is a short-burst event in which individuals typically form teams to intensively collaborate on projects which are designed around the problem statement or ideas provided by the hackathon organizers.

A hackathon is underpinned and identified by these core tenants:
- Creative poblem solving, which does not have to include a technological (software, etc.) component. 
- A gathering of individuals working together, attempting to solve a common problem or set of problems.

## Why run a Hackathon?

There are many reasons to run a hackathon. Recruiting talents, marketing a product (or a company) and building new skillsets, to name a few. There are different ways to run a hackathon and as mentioned above, at least within Microsoft, we have two categories; Community and Internal hackathons.  

**For internal**: We see a hackathon being run in the internal format when we want to build muscles for the employees. 
  - For sales, they need to be trained in products they are selling. Hackathon allows hands-on experience with new/existing products they may not be familiar with. It will help them to understand how the products can help the customers and engage with them more personally.
  - For solution architects, they need to know the ins and outs of the products they are solutioning for the customers. Hackathon can give them an opportunity to solution real world scenarios, that they might not have otherwise encountered, in depth. 
  - For engineers, they need to know how different services/products work to incorporate into their own product. You can imagine a tech company that is big as Microsoft has enormous amount of services we offer and not all engineering teams are familiar with all the offerings. Hackathon would be a great way for one team to learn about other products and also build collaboration with other teams.

- Community:
  - Sourcing ideas from the community.
  - Recruiting.
  - Marketing.

## Problem Types and Categories

Without a problem to address, or categorical area of focus, participants in a hackathon are likely to spend too much time trying to determine a path and may ultimately not provide value to the intended goal of the event. For this reason it is important to define the problem statement, and or areas of focus ahead of time.

Keep in mind that even if you do ask the participants to bring their own problem statements (which is completely fine), it's helpful to provide problem types or categories to help keep the event focused. Remember, hackathons generally have a constrained amount of time. One of the most difficult components of that aspect is balancing specific direction and ideation of the partipants.

The additional focus helps participants understand the goals of the hackathon. The topic(s) may also help participants understand what skills or experiences may be needed, in addition to the expected outcomes. This is especially important when it may be helpful to have less technical individuals on the team that may bring other skills to bear (eg. experience in that type of situation, industry experience, etc.). 

The additional categorical focus should also make it easier to identify and recruit coaches and panelists - subject matter or technical. If you know that you want to focus on building a next-generation Medical Records System, then you know you'll likely need expertise in Heathcare, EMRs, Software Development, and Data Development.

## Roles

Although some hacakthons seem to be an event where people show up and do their own thing, that's likely intentional, and a lot of work goes into these events. While not all of the below roles are required for each type of hackathon, these are common functions within hackathons.

- Organizers - this role often represents one or more of the following personas:
  - Budget holders - approve any expenses
  - Marketing - define and execute a marketing plan to attract participants and raise public awareness
  - Technologists - provisioning or creating any required resources (eg. Website, Microsoft teams, etc.)
- Support - depending on the size of the event, this may require one or more of the following personas:
  - Topic Leads
    - One for each "topic" or category
    - Moderates sharing sessions at the end of the hackathon which align with their topic or category.
    - Will work to attract people specific to their problem space.
  - Tech Mentors - deep technical expertise in topic-relevant areas; ideally each team will have a tech mentor.
  - Agile/Design Thinking Mentors - individuals skilled in helping teams break down problems and drive for a Minimally Viable Product (MVP).
- Participants - individuals that are (hopefully) working on a team with others. The more diversity of talent, skills, experiences, and background on a team the more learning oportunities for everyone in addition to a better deliverable.
  
## Defining Success

With any hackathon, its important to define success early in order to drive further decisions on how the event is run, teams are formed, etc.

- Organizer Goals: Is the goal to...
  - Education of a technology, product, or concept?
  - Build functioning solutions?
  - Source ideas for a problem?
  - Encourage business development?
  - Create or grow a community?

- How will you (quantitatively) measure success of the goal(s)?
  - Participants progress through the selected training material?
  - Amount of dollars invested in project(s)?
  - Number of projects advancing to a "business stage"?

- Expected outcomes from participants?
  - Slideware concept of a solution?
  - Functioning Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?

## Open Source

We believe open source is a great fit for hackathons. If this is the case for your event, you will need to be clear that any artifacts that are an outcome of the event will be open sourced under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). A communication can be used with the participants along the lines of the following.

>Because people are coming together from many different places to join solution teams or act as mentors, and none of these people will have signed NDAs, we are requiring all ideas, code, and documentation generated during the event is open sourced under the MIT license.​

The MIT license allows anyone can build on the output of the event – be that new contributions from the community or use by commercial solutions.​
