# Internal Hackathon
This page is designed to provide guidance, and ideas on running a Internal Hackathon.  

## Steps to run a Internal Hackathon

#### 1. Determine Name, Purpose and Outcomes of the Hackathon
For a start, deciding on what you want to achieve from running a hackathon is important. A well-run internal hackathon is great for team building and cross-disciplinary collaboration, as youâ€™ll be able to encourage people to work outside of their regular cliques.
For eg, every team has to include members from different functions (Engineering/Product/Design, Marketing, Sales, and Customer Support & Success) or different skill levels to ensure a mix of talents and experience in every group.

#### 2. Get everyone involved even before the event
